Estimates are used for such items as the collectability of trade accounts receivable and inventory valuation.  Ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\n \\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\n – We establish an allowance for credit losses to reduce trade accounts receivable to an amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable value. Our accounts receivable allowance consists of an allowance for expected credit losses which is established through a review of open accounts, historical collection, and historical write-off amounts.

Product offerings include a wide variety of furniture such as sofas, loveseats, chairs, reclining rocking chairs, swivel rockers, sofa beds, convertible bedding units, occasional tables, desks, dining tables and chairs, kitchen storage, bedroom furniture, and outdoor furniture. A featured component in most of the upholstered furniture is a unique steel drop-in seat spring from which the name “Flexsteel” is derived. The Company distributes its products throughout the United States through its e-commerce channel and direct sales force.\\n \\nThe Company operates in one reportable segment, furniture products.  The Company’s furniture products business involves the distribution of manufactured and imported products consisting of a broad line of furniture for the residential market. In fiscal 2020, the Company substantially completed its exit from the Commercial Office and custom design Hospitality product lines which served contract markets. During fiscal 2021, the Company substantially completed its restructuring activities related to the exit of its Vehicle Seating and the remainder of its Hospitality product lines, which also served contract markets.

On June 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 34 employees located in Asia to ensure Flexsteel’s quality standards are met and to coordinate the delivery of products acquired from overseas suppliers.  The Company leases and operates three manufacturing facilities in Juarez, Mexico and leases one manufacturing facility in Mexicali, Mexico and had approximately 1,200 employees located in Mexico on June 30, 2023. The four Mexico facilities total 1,061,000 square feet. As of June 30, 2023, the Company has not begun operations in the Mexicali facility and had subleased approximately 105,000 square feet.

The Company purchases these materials from numerous outside suppliers, both U.S. and foreign, and is not dependent upon any single source of supply.

The Company owns other patents and owns certain trademarks in connection with its furniture.\\n \\nIt is not common in the furniture industry to obtain a patent for a furniture design.  If a particular design of a furniture manufacturer is well accepted in the marketplace, it is common for other manufacturers to imitate the same design without recourse by the furniture manufacturer who initially introduced the design.

The Company competes in markets with a large number of relatively small manufacturers; however, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes than the Company.  The Company’s products compete based on style, quality, price, delivery, service and durability.

The Company identifies and eliminates manufacturing inefficiencies and adjusts manufacturing schedules on a daily basis to meet customer requirements.  The Company has established relationships with key suppliers to ensure prompt delivery of quality component parts.

In addition, the majority of our manufactured products are produced in Mexico.  The wages of our employees and certain other employee benefit and indirect costs are made in Pesos.  The Company does not employ any foreign currency hedges against this exposure. A negative shift in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Peso could increase the cost of manufacturing.\\n \\nOur ability to recover these cost increases through price increases may continue to lag the cost increases, resulting in downward pressure on margins. In addition, price increases to offset rising costs could negatively impact demand for our products. \\n \\nThe Company’s products are considered deferrable purchases for consumers during economic downturns.

If we were unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity.\\n \\nFinally, the Company relies on third parties to deliver customer orders. The capacity of these third parties or cost of this service could be impacted by labor disputes, cost inflation (particularly fuel), and availability of drivers which could increase cost and have negative impacts on our earnings.\\n \\nCompetition from U.S. and foreign finished product manufacturers may adversely affect the business, operating results or financial condition.\\n \\nThe furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented.

The primary reasons for these changes include a decrease in net sales, lower gross margin, and an increase in SG&A expenses. The decrease in net sales was due to declining consumer demand and competitive pressure to lower prices. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to deleverage on year-over-year sales decline and higher incentive compensation. The decrease in gross margin was due to pricing promotions, inventory write-downs, and capacity growth investments in manufacturing and distribution.\n",

Despite the decline from the peak in 2021, the significant rise from the low of $1.9 million in fiscal 2022 to $14.8 million in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to improved gross margins resulting from cost-saving measures and lower ancillary charges, coupled with a substantial income tax benefit in fiscal 2023 due to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.\n",
